Let's get to know each other!**

## About Me
A few months ago, I had the opportunity to participate in a meeting where specialists from various fields of IT talked about their work.  
Then I had my first contact with Software Testing.  
When I listened to what the tester's work looks like, what problems he or she has to pay attention to, I thought to myself:
"OMG, this is something for me!".

And here I am :wink:

Here You can find infirmation about my hard work to became tester.

I will tell you where my basic knowledge comes from, where I am inspired and what I already know.  
Part of the project will have the description 'in progress' or 'soon', which means that I am currently working on a given part of my portfolio or will start working on it next.
